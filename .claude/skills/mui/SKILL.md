# MUI Rules

## 1. Use MUI components directly

- Import from `@mui/material` — no custom wrappers unless strictly required.

```tsx
// Good
import { Button, TextField, Stack } from '@mui/material';

// Bad — unnecessary wrapper
import { CustomButton } from '@/components/ui/CustomButton';
```

## 2. NEVER use Box

Use semantic MUI components instead:
- `Stack` for flex layouts
- `Container` for page containers
- `Paper` for elevated surfaces
- `Card` for content cards
- `Grid` for grid layouts

## 3. NEVER use className

Always use `sx` prop or theme — no `className` on MUI components.

## 4. Styling strategy — the two-case mental model

There are exactly TWO places a style can live. There is no third case.

- **Global** (a design decision that applies everywhere — colors, surfaces, glass effects, radii, typography, component looks) → the **theme** (`packages/ui/src/universal/minimalism/`), via palette + `components` styleOverrides.
- **Situational** (one single component, one spot) → the `sx` prop on that component.

**The litmus test: swapping the theme provider must be the ENTIRE re-skin of an app.** Wrap the app in a different provider and every screen must look right with zero extra work. If a screen looks wrong after a provider swap, that is a styling hack in our code — a component hardcoding what the theme owns — and the hack gets fixed (moved into the theme, or reduced to a real one-off `sx`), never patched around with app-specific styling.

Corollary: never restyle a component to "match" a design system — if many components need the same look, that look belongs in the theme's `styleOverrides`, once.

## 5. NEVER use px units

Use relative units that scale with user preferences:

| Property | Bad | Good |
|----------|-----|------|
| fontSize | `'14px'` | `'0.875rem'` |
| lineHeight | `'20px'` | `1.429` (unitless) |
| letterSpacing | `'0.5px'` | `'0.035em'` |
| spacing/padding/margin | `'16px'` | `theme.spacing(2)` or `sx={{ p: 2 }}` |
| width/height | `'300px'` | `theme.spacing(37.5)` or responsive values |

## 6. NEVER hardcode colors

- No hex/rgb in components — always use theme palette.
- Missing color? Add it to the theme first.
- Every color must survive BOTH light and dark mode. `grey[100]`, `#e0e0e0`, `'white'` in a component are latent dark-mode bugs — use mode-aware tokens (`background.paper`, `action.hover`, `text.secondary`, …) that the theme resolves per mode.

```tsx
// Bad
<Paper sx={{ bgcolor: '#193c4d' }} />

// Good
<Paper sx={{ bgcolor: 'background.paper' }} />
```

## 7. Container/Presentational pattern

For complex components:

```
src/components/features/[feature]/
  index.tsx           # Container — state, hooks, API calls
  [Feature]UI.tsx     # Presentational — pure rendering from props
  [Feature].stories.tsx  # Storybook — tests UI directly
```

**Container** (`index.tsx`): manages state, fetches data, contains handlers, passes everything to UI via props.

**UI** (`[Feature]UI.tsx`): pure presentational — no state, no hooks, no API calls. All data via props.

**Storybook** (`[Feature].stories.tsx`): tests UI component directly with mocked props. No API mocking needed.
